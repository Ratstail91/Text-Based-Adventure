mainline

determine the "dir" table, which is used as a directroy reference throughout TBA

enter the main loop
	read the text input
	parse the input, and act accordingly
	if the return value signals something went wrong, output the error
end the main loop

-------------------------

Parsing

split the input into a table
remove the first entry on the table, this is the "command"
depending on the command, call the correct "action function" and pass the remaining table to that function
return the value returned from the action function
if the correct action function can't be found, return a PARSE_ERROR

-------------------------

Return values from parsing include:
	QUIT
	NORMAL
	PARSE_ERROR


First Order Actions (the first word parsed) can include:
	help
	look
	move
	door
	do
	use
	take
	drop
	inventory
