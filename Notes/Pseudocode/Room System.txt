roomlist --the global name for the game's roomlist

room:
	name
	description
	itemlist
	doorlist
	xxxlist
end

There will only be one roomlist loaded at once, and loading a new one will override the previous roomlist, so it should probably be saved into the gamesave. The rooms in a roomlist should be created when the roomlist is made, as should the items. So... the syntax in the game files should look something like this:


	roomlist = {} --also deletes the previous one
	
	...
	
	--create the library
	local room = newroom("library", "General Custard was here earlier, with a candlestick.")
	
	room.newitem("bfg", GUN, "a custom built gun")
	room.newitem("clothes", CLOTHING, "a T-shirt & shorts")
	
	roomlist.insert(room)
	
	...
	
	room.newdoor("north", roomlist["parlour"])
	room.newdoor("south", roomlist["outside"])
	
	...
	
	location.setroomlist(roomlist)


The rooms should be created and added to the roomlist first, before adding the doors, since the other rooms will probably need to exist already.
