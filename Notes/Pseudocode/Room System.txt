An idea for the TBA room structure
location - a set of rooms loaded at once
room - index, name, description, item list & door list; is saved with the save file so that items aren’t duplicated.
item - game specific “thing”, to be implemented
door - name, index, the name is what you type (i.e. “north”, “forward”) and the index is the room you move to.
    structure
    location:
        room list
    room:
        door list
        item list
just an idea of how to implement movement in the TBA.
