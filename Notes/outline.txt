What I want:
	A reusable text based adventure game engine.

Features:
*	Runs off of an external script. The script could take the form of a single file, or a directory tree as deemed necessary during development.
*	The engine must be easy to use and to hack.

Design:
	This needs at least a basic text parser, a save system, a way to save "states" and a format for the external scripts.
	
	Parser:
		The parser syntax would be something like:
		
		*	COMMAND [parameters]
		
		Where command could be any of these:
		
		*	inventory
		*	open
		*	close
		*	pickup/take
		*	drop/give
		*	etc.
	
	Save system:
		Needs to save each state correctly.
	
	State:
		A state needs a name, and a value.
		A state could be anything from health and money, to advancement through a plot, to the current location.
	
	Scripts:
		The scripts will hold the indevidual games, form beginning to end, hopefully without any necessary modification to the engine.

Choices:
*	A premade engine
*	A custom built engine
*	hacking lua.c


Example:
	state:
		health 100
		money 0
		door closed
