-------------------------

Major:

>	Parser
*	Movement around several rooms, and several locations
*	Manipulation of items, both in an inventory and in the world

*		pickup/drop
*		push/pull
*		lock/unlock

*		Could use items like keys on a door, and could have items like levers that can't be collected, only used

*	Loading predesigned games (Bear-Land, Adventure-World)
*	Saving/loading of locations, rooms, items and character attributes

-	"Intro" and "exit" functions for rooms (entering a room causes a cave in, can't move back, etc.). This could be done in the game files.

-------------------------

Structural/design:

*	a Module to generate locations, rooms, etc. (this is factory, but is incomplete)
>	Generic functions file for split, table size, etc.

*	Should things like rooms, locations, items, etc. have identifyers?
*	table.type = X where x is:

*		LOCATION	= 201
*		ROOM		= 202
*		ITEM		= 203
*		...and so on (use 10x for parser returns, 20x for objects, etc.)

*	The active system seems too similar to singletons, I'll need to see if there's another way to do that after the room system is completed.
*	Don't use the factory system, use indevidual systems like rooms, items, etc. DONT GROUP THEM TOGETHER LIKE THIS.

-------------------------

Minor:

*	"location" needs a better, less ambiguous term
