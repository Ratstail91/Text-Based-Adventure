The "story":

The player starts in toom 4

The player moves into room 3, just before a cave in blocks the path between 3 & 4

The door to room 5 is locked, so they must look for a key

They will find the key in room 1, and then return to room 3

Using the key on the door, they can unlock it

They find an exit door inside room 5, and finish the game


Breakdown:

This demo uses the following aspects of the engine:

*   one and two way doors
*   items and the inventory
*   locked doors and keys
*   event triggers (the cave in event)
